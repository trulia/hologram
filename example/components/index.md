# Welcome to the example hologram style guide!

This style guide and the examples given within are based off of [Trulia](http://trulia.com)'s own css library and style guide.

There are a couple of things to note as you poke around.

1. The example css given is stripped from our own library. We use [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) at Trulia and instead of making these examples depend on Sass we've just included the compiled css for a couple of components. If the organization looks a little weird and the components don't seem to have exactly the css you would expect it's because they look nothing like the Sass that spawned them.

2. The header and footer CSS is separated out from the CSS used to actually generate the code blocks. Feel free to use it if you'd like, or eat your own dog food and use your own CSS to create a style guide that matches your site.

3. This is a work in progress, please consider contributing to [hologram](http://github.com/trulia/hologram).
